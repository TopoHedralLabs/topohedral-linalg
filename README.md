# Welcome to Topohedral-Linalg!

``topohedral-linalg`` is a crate for small, dense linear algebra which provides a rusty interface 
to blas/lapack backends. A key feature is expression templates which allow lazily-evaluated, 
element wise expressions. This library is part of the Topohedral Project of TopoHedralLabs, an 
open-source geometric modelling kernel.
